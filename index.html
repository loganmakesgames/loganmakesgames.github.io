          Hi, my name is Logan! I am a self-taught developer working on crummy games. I love learning, even when it makes me feel a bit in-over-my-head! Thank you for visiting my page, and please check the sidebar for ways to connect with me.

          "....." is an experimental game built to be played with no audio or visuals. It uses controller vibration to communicate information to the player. Originally, I intended it to have DualSense adaptive trigger support, so development was centered around using the DualSense controller. As a result, it requires a DualSense controller to play. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the trigger support to work in a consistent and satisfying way, so it was ultimately dropped.<br>
          <br>
          Despite this, I am pretty happy with the final product! I've had great opportunities to watch people play the game and to hear how they interpretted the enemies and environments. It's fascinating to hear how an area of the game that I designed might be recontextualized based on how the player imagines where they are!
