          Hi, my name is Logan! I am a self-taught developer working on crummy games. I love learning, even when it makes me feel a bit in-over-my-head! Thank you for visiting my page, and please check the sidebar for ways to connect with me.

          "NADYR" is my upcoming survival horror inspired RPG. You play as a party of four individuals as they explore a twisted mansion that devolves into something much stranger. Solve puzzles, manage items, and slug it out in RPG-styled active time battles!<br>
          <br>
          Although I had some coding experience under my belt when I started "NADYR", I've learned a lot during the development process. Progress has been slow, but the hope is that it will be out before the end of 2025! If it sounds at all interesting, feel free to check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2676460/NADYR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam page</a>!<br>

          "....." is an experimental game built to be played with no audio or visuals. It uses controller vibration to communicate information to the player. Originally, I intended it to have DualSense adaptive trigger support, so development was centered around using the DualSense controller. As a result, it requires a DualSense controller to play. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the trigger support to work in a consistent and satisfying way, so it was ultimately dropped.<br>
          <br>
          Despite this, I am pretty happy with the final product! I've had great opportunities to watch people play the game and to hear how they interpretted the enemies and environments. It's fascinating to hear how an area of the game that I designed might be recontextualized based on how the player imagines where they are!

          "HODAG" is my first solo-developed game. The objective of the game is to roam the icy wilderness in search of parts for your broken down truck, all while avoiding the dreaded Hodag. The game is a very simple, first-person exploration game with very rudimentary shooting mechanics. The main challenge of the game comes from navigating the environment and exploring.<br>
          <br>
          "HODAG" was my first "real" foray into game development and I learned a LOT in the process! Before "HODAG", I barely knew how to code. I had a little experience with Python via the Python for Everybody free online courses, but my knowledge of code was nearly zero when I began making the game.<br>
          <br>
          Making a game like this, with no experience, was honestly transformative. My game development skills have come so far since this humble game. It just goes to show that the best way to learn is to just go for it!

          "First Person Shoveler" is a simple first-person platformer game made for Godot Wild Jam #45. The game takes place in a small arena, wherein the player must find dirt mounds to dig up. Once the mound has been dug up, they must solve a simple math problem to obtain the treasure!<br>
          <br>
          The programming was handled by <a href="https://www.snopekgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DevLogLogan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Logan</a> (not me), and the absolutely stellar music was created by <a href="https://jamphibious.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamphibious</a>. Since I did not know how to code, all of the 3D models (except the shovel) and much of the level design were my responsibility.<br>
          <br>
          The level is designed to be a smal arena with multiple "paths". The philosophy behind my level design for this project was "no turning back". Every path in the arena is designed in a way that the player should never run into a dead end. Especially for a game with a timer, I wanted to avoid having the player walk into a room and feel like they've wasted their time because they didn't find any treasure. Instead, they could continue forward and loop into a new room, where they may find treasure instead!
